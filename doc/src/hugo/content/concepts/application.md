An application in RIDDL represents an interface portion of a system where an 
actor (human or machine) initiates an action on the system. Applications 
only define the net result of the interaction between the actor and the 
application. That is, there is nothing in RIDDL that defines how information 
is provided nor received. This gives free latitude to the user interface 
designer to manage the entire interaction between human and machine.
