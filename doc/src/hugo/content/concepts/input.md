An Input is the abstract notion of some information provided to an 
application by its user (an [actor]({{< relref actor.md>}})). To make this more
tangible, inputs could be implemented as any of the following:
* the submission of a typical htML form a user could fill in,
* the tap of a button on a mobile device,
* the selection of items from a list on a native application, 
* a voice response providing information via any
  [IVR](https://wikipedia.com/en/IVR) system,
* a thought interpreted by a neural link,
* a physical movement interpreted by a motion-detection device,
* a retinal scan,
* picking items from lists of information by looking and blinking
* or any other system by which a human may provide information to a machine

The nature of the implementation for an input is up to the UI Designer.
RIDDL's concept of it is based on the net result: the data type received by
the application. 

An input is a named component of an [application]({{< relref application.md>}}) 
that receives data of a specific [type]({{< relref type.md >}}) from an  
[actor]({{< relref actor.md>}}) (user) of the application. Each input can define 
data [types]({{< relref type.md >}}) and declares a 
[command message]({{< relref "message.md#command" >}}) as the data received
by the application's input.

## Occurs In
* [Group]({{< relref "group.md" >}})

## Contains
* [Type]({{< relref "type.md" >}})
* [Message]({{< relref "message.md" >}})
