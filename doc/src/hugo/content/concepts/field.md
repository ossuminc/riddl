Fields are the unit of composition of an aggregate type, state, or 
projection. A field is a simple mapping of a name to a type. For example:

```name: Number```

specifies that the field named `name` has type `Number`. Fields are used in 
[actions]({{< relref "action" >}}) and 
[expressions]({{< relref "expression" >}}) to supply values over which 
computations are performed.
