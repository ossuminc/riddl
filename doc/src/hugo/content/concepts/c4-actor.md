title: "C4 Actor"
draft: false

A C4 Actor in RIDDL is the same thing as a 
[Person]() in the [C4 Model](). We changed the name to _Actor_ because we 
did not want to constrain it to a person but allow it to be anything that 
can interact with the system defined by the RIDDL model; whether that is 
living, mechanical, or otherwise.
