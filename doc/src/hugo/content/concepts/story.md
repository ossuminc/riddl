A story is a definition that defines an agile user story. This is the same 
concept that [Kent Beck] popularized in the early 2000s with [eXtreme 
Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/). In RIDDL, a story is 
composed of the
following things:

* An `role` specification giving the role played by the narrator of the story
* A `capability` specification giving the capability used by the narrator
* A `benefit` specification providing the reason why the narrator wants to use the `capability`
* A `accepted by` specification expressed as Gherkin examples that defines done.
* A `implemented by` specification that links the story to the various RIDDL definitions involved in
  the implementation of this story
