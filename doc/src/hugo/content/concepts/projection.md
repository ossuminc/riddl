Projections get their name from  
[Euclidean Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics)) 
but are probably more analogous to a 
[relational database view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)). The 
concept is very simple in RIDDL: projections gather data from entities and 
other sources, transform that data into a specific record type, and support
querying that data arbitrarily.

Projections transform update events from entities into a data set that can 
be more easily queried. Projections have handlers that specify both how to
apply updates to the projections state and satisfy queries against that state.
A projection's data is always duplicate and not the system of record for the
data. Typically persistent entities are the system of record for the data.
