An Outlet is a component of a 
[Processor]({{< relref "processor" >}}) that specifies a named output through
which data of a particular type streams out of the processor. When an Inlet is
defined in an [Entity]({{< relref "entity.md" >}}), the entity acts only as
a `source` processor, generating events.
