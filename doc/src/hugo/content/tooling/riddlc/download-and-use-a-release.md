Starting with the 0.6.0 a "universal" release bundle is made available for
Linux and MacOS Systems directly from GitHub. You can find them in the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/reactific/riddl/releases) section
under "Assets". Note that not all releases have these assets. 

After downloading the `.zip` asset, you should:

* Move that `.zip` file to somewhere in your home directory
* Unpack that `.zip` file with  `unzip <path-to-tgz>`
* That will give you a directory like `riddl-0.6.0/bin` (the version # might
  be different)
* Put that `bin` directory in your path
* Now you can just run “riddlc” from anywhere
* Some day we will have a packaged installer.
