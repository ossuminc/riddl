The [Kalix](https://kalix.io/) platform-as-a-service system represents one of 
the easiest methods by which RIDDL models can be turned into running systems.
The `riddlc` program generates Kalix style protobuffers files from the RIDDL 
model. Kalix uses these files to generate Scala, Java, Javascript or Python code
with a *fill-in-the-blanks* style for just the business logic.
