The RIDDL compiler, `riddlc` is able to translate RIDDL into a variety of other
document types, after the input passes the [compilation phases](../compilation).  

The various kinds of output from `riddlc` are described in the following 
sections:

* [_Hugo_](hugo) - Hugo source input for producing an HTML website
  diagrams are all automatically deduced from the RIDDL model

It is recommended that you become familiar with the `riddlc` [command line and configuration options](options) as these control the kind of output generated.
