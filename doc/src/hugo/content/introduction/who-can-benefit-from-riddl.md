RIDDL is technology-agnostic, but not design-agnostics. It is purposefully 
aimed at the design of large scale, distributed systems based on 
reactive architecture. It allows specification of the design of a system, 
without regard to programming language, cloud vendor choice, or specific 
technology choices. Using RIDDL allows a living design to evolve through
every stage of the development process and then through continuing
maintenance and evolution of the system designed.

Consequently, the people who can benefit from RIDDL are those who are 
building such systems that want a precise and consistent way of specifying its
evolving design as a guide to all stakeholders.
