RIDDL gets its name from an acronym that stands for *Reactive Interface with
Domain Definition Language*.



RIDDL is a specification language for the niche of large, distributed,
reactive, concurrent systems such as required for modern internet-scale 
applications or corporate back office infrastructure. 

RIDDL is a variety of software libraries and tools, provided in 
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactific/riddl), that 
allow humans to work with the language to create their own derivative works. 

[`riddlc`] is a complete extensible compiler infrastructure for processing 
RIDDL specifications. It uses a plugin system to allow new commands to be added
to it for generating information from a RIDDL specification. For more details, 
please see the [tooling section]({{< relref "tooling" >}})
