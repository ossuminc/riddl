## I Need A Bug Fixed
While [RIDDL](https://github.com/reactific/riddl) is competent enough to be used 
for live updated documentation of the design of as software project, we 
still consider it to be in a pre-release, early preview stage. Consequently, 
we are very eager to perfect it and your bug submission will help with that. 

Please submit your bug via 
[GitHub at this location](https://github.com/reactific/riddl/issues/new). In 
the comment area, please ensure you do the following:
* Provide the release version that the `riddlc version` command puts out.
* Provide a clear statement of the symptom of the bug. The symptom is what 
  you notice that is wrong. 
* Provide a minimal reproduction case. Usually that involves providing as 
  small a sample of RIDDL source code as possible that makes the symptom 
  happen. This will be added to RIDDL's regression test suite. _NOTE: If we 
  can't reproduce the symptom, we cannot provide a fix to it._
* Label your new issue with the "Bug" (red) label so we are sure to 
  prioritize it.  

## I Need RIDDL To Generate Something Else
These kinds of requests are very important to us. We are very interested in 
creating a set of useful RIDDL translators for many kinds of purposes. For 
these kinds of feature request, please bypass GitHub and reach out directly 
to [Reid Spencer]({{< relref "who-made-riddl-possible.md#reid-spencer" >}} 
at `reid@ossum.biz` 

## I Want To Make A Feature Suggestion

There are many things we want to do with RIDDL, some of them are documented on
the [future work]({{< relref "../future-work" >}}) page. You can also find a 
list of new features already requested by 
[clicking here](https://github.com/reactific/riddl/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

We would appreciate help with implementing new features and suggest that you 
clone the repository and submit a branch and a pull request. 

If your feature suggestion is not already recorded and you're unable to 
implement the feature yourself, please submit your feature suggestion via
[GitHub at this location](https://github.com/reactific/riddl/issues/new). 
Please ensure you do the following:
* Provide a clear statement of the feature you are suggesting we implement. 
  Be as detailed as you can. We can handle it! :)
* Label your new issue with the "Enhancement" (mint green) label and any 
  other label that helps categorize it (except "Bug"). 


## I Need Commercial Support

Commercial support is available by sending an email describing your needs to
[Reid Spencer]({{< relref "who-made-riddl-possible.md#reid-spencer" >}} at
`reid@ossum.biz`. Reid will consider your request and suggest a time to have 
a Zoom conference call to discuss further.
