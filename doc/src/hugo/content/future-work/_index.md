This section provides some insight into our plans to extend RIDDL or use it in
novel ways:

* Akka source generation
* Kubernetes deployment descriptors
* Protobuffers message and service definitions
* Fast data message streaming infrastructure


* [_BAST_](bast) - Binary Abstract Syntax Tree. Generates files that capture the
  abstract syntax tree (AST) in a transportable binary format
* [_Diagrams_](diagrams) - Data flow, sequence, entity, context maps, and other
* [_OpenAPI_](openapi) - OpenAPI (formerly called Swagger) specifications for APIs
  implied in the RIDDL model
* [_Kalix_](kalix) - Kalix protobuffers source generation as input to the Kalix
  code generator.
* [_Akka_](akka) - Akka, protobuffers, Alpakka infrastructure code & skeleton
* [_Others_](others) - plugins can be written to convert the AST into any other
  kind of needed data
