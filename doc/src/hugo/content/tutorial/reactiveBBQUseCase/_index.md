## About Reactive BBQ
The Reactive BBQ domain is a familiar one for those who have taken the 
Lightbend Reactive Architecture Professional (LRA-P) course. That course uses 
this example throughout to good effect in the workshops. The same premises 
apply in this tutorial. We go deeper into reactive architecture by having you 
specify portions of it in RIDDL.

As you might guess from the name, Reactive BBQ is a restaurant chain that 
serves spicy (reactive!) BBQ dishes.  It doesn't exist of course, even if 
we may or may not have mistaken [R&R BBQ in Salt Lake City](https://randrbbq.com/) 
for the _Reactive_ version in 2018.

The Reactive BBQ case study in the LRA-P course included interviews with several
fictitious employees. Those interviews and the case study material have been 
replicated here with thanks to Lightbend; we recommend that you read through 
this case study first.

The RIDDL files for Reactive BBQ are arranged into a directory structure, each
with an explanation page as follows:

- [Reactive BBQ Domain](reactivebbq)
    - [Restaurant](restaurant)
    - [BackOffice](backoffice)
    - [Corporate](corporate)

## Case Study
The Reactive BBQ restaurant chain has determined that their existing restaurant
operations system is not suitably meeting their needs and have hired a high 
technology consulting company (you) to provide some needed guidance on how they 
can improve their customer service, tracking, and reliability. 

What follows are the interviews conducted with key personnel at Reactive BBQ
in order to identify the issues. 

- [Reactive BBQ CEO](ceo)
