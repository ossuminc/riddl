RIDDL uses Gherkin examples in various places to express a functionality or behavior requirement on
the definition that uses it. Gherkin examples are used in these places:

* [Adaptors](../root/domain/context/adaptor)
* [Entity Handlers](../root/domain/context/entity/handler.md)
* [Functions](./functions.md)
* [Processors](../root/domain/streaming/processor.md)
* [Saga Actions](../root/domain/context/saga)
* [Story](../root/domain/story)

## Structure

[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) is a language developed by
[SmartBear Software](https://smartbear.com/company/about-us/), a vendor of software quality tools,
for the [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) testing system. RIDDL uses a subset of the language as
SmartBear has defined it. Four constructs are used in RIDDL:

* _GIVEN_ - A description of the scenario, environment, or setting of the example
* _WHEN_ - A condition that must be true for this example to be applicable
* _THEN_ - An action, or set of actions, that are to be performed
* _BUT_ - An action, or set of actions, that are not to be performed

## Example

```riddl
example AllDone is {
  Given "I am out shopping"
  And "I have eggs"
  And "I have milk"
  And "I have butter"
  When "I check my list"
  Then "I don't need anything"
}
```
