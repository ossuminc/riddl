Domain experts (DEs) are subject matter experts (SMEs) in some knowledge
or problem domain. They are the authority on the language used to describe
both problems and solutions within their domain or field of expertise. These
individuals are recognized authorities, and they influence an organization's
product, service or strategic direction.

Domain experts may or may not
be in leadership positions, but they are people who are broadly trusted
for their knowledge of business rules, processes, technical details,
and system requirements.

These are the [EF_Huttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByhYlY5WVvQ) of the
organization.

While not a comprehensive list, these people may be Architects, Analysts,
Developers, Managers, QA Engineers, or even Call Center Agents, and line
workers from the warehouse.

Domain Experts do not need to be well versed in DDD or Reactive Architecture
initially. It is the job of the Author to act as a guide and mentor through
these topics. But Domain Experts must be open to change what is for what
could be. Reactive Architectures can be very challenging for people to digest.
More specifically, quite often techniques used to implement distributed and
reactive systems will change user experiences, expectations of consistency
and availability, the means used to monitor and maintain systems and processes,
and so on. Domain experts will need to come to understand the reasons for
these changes and be able to evangelize them as they interact with their peers.
