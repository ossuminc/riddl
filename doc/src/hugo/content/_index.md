<img src="/images/RIDDL-Logo.svg" align="left" width="100px"/>IDDL is a 
language and toolset for specifying a system design. RIDDL is not
a programming language, but it uses ideas from prior works, unique 
combinations of those ideas, and some original ideas.  
 
Before we get into the details, let's review the structure of this 
documentation, so that you may utilize it efficiently.  

Everyone should read the [Introduction]({{< relref "./introduction">}}) 
section as it provides a high level introduction to RIDDL, defines what RIDDL 
is, what it can do, what it is based upon, who helped it come to fruition, and 
how to get help. Definitely start with the 
[Introduction]({{< relref "./introduction" >}}) if you're new to RIDDL.

Everyone should also read the 
[Conceptual Overview]({{< relref "./concepts" >}}) which 
describes the various definitional concepts used by RIDDL. This section will 
give you a complete understanding of the ideas used in RIDDL, without worrying
about the syntax of the language that is used to express those ideas.

People involved with RIDDL come from many professional roles so there are 
[Guides]({{< relref "./guides" >}}) that provide learning paths for those 
various roles.  

For those that like to learn incrementally, there is a 
[Tutorial]({{< relref "./tutorial" >}}) that walks the reader through the 
construction of a RIDDL model for a restaurant chain, and the resulting 
software system to operate it.

If you want to dive into the technical specification for the RIDDL language,
you can go to the [Language]({{< relref "./language" >}}) section and learn
the language syntax and grammar.

If you want to learn to use the tools that RIDDL provides, you can go to 
the [Tooling]({{< relref "./tooling" >}}) section and learn how to install and 
use them. 

If you're interested in knowing how we plan to extend RIDDl in the future, 
please review our [Future Work]({{< relref "./future-work" >}}) section.
