Developers are the technical experts that advance RIDDL's state of the art. They
develop the tooling and documentation that makes up RIDDL. Since RIDDL is an
open source project, developers can be affiliated with many organizations,
presumably the organizations that derive utility from RIDDL.

Developers must be experts in:
* Domain Drive Design
* Scala Programming Lanauge
* Li Haoyi's fastparse
* Compiler Design
* Functional programming concepts like folding, AST, etc.
* Test Driven Development
* Build Automation
* Agile Engineering Practices
