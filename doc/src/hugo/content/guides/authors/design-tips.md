## Domain Hierarchy
When considering how to organize your specification into a set , there are no formal rules.
Domains are *fuzzy* concepts on purpose. However, here are a few things that might help:

* [Domain, Subdomain, Bounded Context, Problem/Solution Space in DDD: Clearly Defined](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/domains-subdomain-problem-solution-space-in-ddd-clearly-defined-e0b49c7b586c)
* [Domain Drive Design: Domain Definition](https://xenovation.com/blog/patterns/domain-driven-design-glossary/ddd-domain-definition)
* Use the communication structure of the organization per [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
* Use the [Event Storming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming#Steps)
  and then look for the event groupings. Isolated groups are typically subdomains.
