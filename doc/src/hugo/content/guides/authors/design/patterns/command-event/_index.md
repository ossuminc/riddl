## Introduction To Messages
If you are not familiar with the concept of `Messages` as it pertains to RIDDL,
see [here]({{< relref "concepts/message.md" >}}). This document pertains only
to Commands and Events.

## Backend v Gateway
This design spec considers only designing services themselves. As such it ignores
usability features like fine-grained command
parameters for updating data, unless justified. In a gateway service more consideration would have to be made for usability.

## Problem Statement
There are implementation designs to be made regarding the arrangement of input
(`Command`) and output (`Event`) data across 
[`Handlers`]({{< relref "concepts/handler.md">}}). This documents pertains 
to all types of `Command Handlers`.


## Preliminary Definitions
In this section we will be trying to figure out how to structure commands for
creating, modifying, and deleting fields on User entities. 

Here are the riddl specs we will be assuming for each example (borrowed from 
the evolving [improving.app](https://improving-app/riddl):

```
entity Organization is {
    state Active is {
        info: Info,
        members: MemberId*,
        contacts: Contacts,
    }
}

type Contacts is {
    primaryContacts: MemberId+,
    billingContacts: MemberId*,
    distributionContacts: MemberId*
}

type Info is {
    name: String,
    address: Address?,
    isPrivate: Boolean,
}

type OrganizationId is Id (Organization)
type MemberId is Id (Member) briefly 
"Member is not relevant here, so it will not be shown here."

type Address is {
    line1: String,
    line2: String,
    city: String,
    stateProvince: String,
    country: String,
    postalCode: PostalCode
}

type MobileNumber is Pattern("\(([0-9]{3})\)([0-9]{3})-([0-9]{4})") 
described as "North American Phone Number standard"

type EmailAddress is String

type CAPostalCode is Pattern("[A-Z]\d[A-Z]\d[A-Z]\d")

type USPostalCode is Pattern("\d{5}(-\d{4})?")

type PostalCode is one of { CAPostalCode, USPostalCode }

### We will be trying to find Events for the following Commands:

command EstablishOrganization {
    info: Info,
    contacts: Contacts
}

command ModifyUserInfo {
    id: OrganizationId,
    info: Info
}

command AddMembersToUser {
    userId: OrganizationId,
    members: MemberId*
}

command ModifyUserContacts {
    userId: MemberId,
    contacts: Contacts
}
```
