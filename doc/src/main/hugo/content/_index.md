<img src="/static/images/RIDDL-Logo.svg" align="left" width="100px"/>IDDL is a 
language and toolset for specifying a system design. RIDDL is *not*
a programming language. This documentation is structured to accommodate 
many learning styles. It is not intended to be read linearly. This page
provides a high level overview of the documentation content.

## Introduction
Everyone should read the [Introduction]({{< relref "./introduction">}}) 
as it answers many fundamental questions about RIDDL, defining what RIDDL 
is, what it can do, what it is based upon, who helped it come to fruition, and 
how to get help.

## Guides
People involved with RIDDL come from many professional roles so there are
[Guides]({{< relref "./guides" >}}) that provide learning paths for those
various roles.

## Concepts
The[Conceptual Overview]({{< relref "./concepts" >}}) describes each of
the dozens of concepts RIDDL uses to help you build a system model. This
will be of interest to people that can think abstractly and just want 
the fact. It is also useful as a reference of the main ideas throughout
your learning journey and is the most frequently referenced section in
the other sections. This conceptual overview is provided without 
reference to the syntax or semantics of RIDDL.

## Tutorial
For those that like to learn incrementally, there is a 
[Tutorial]({{< relref "./tutorial" >}}) that walks the reader through the 
construction of a RIDDL model for a restaurant chain, and the resulting 
software system to operate it.

## Language
If you want to dive into the technical specification for the RIDDL language,
you can go to the [Language]({{< relref "./language" >}}) section and learn
the language syntax and grammar.

## Tooling
If you want to learn to use the tools that RIDDL provides, you can go to 
the [Tooling]({{< relref "./tooling" >}}) section and learn how to install and 
use them. 

## Future Work
If you're interested in knowing how we plan to extend RIDDl in the future, 
please review our [Future Work]({{< relref "./future-work" >}}) section.
