Developers are the technical experts that advance RIDDL's state of the art. They
develop the tooling and documentation that makes up RIDDL. Since RIDDL is an
open source project, developers can be affiliated with many organizations,
presumably the organizations that derive utility from RIDDL.

Developers must be experts in:
in:
* [Scala Programming Language](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [Li Haoyi's fastparse](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/fastparse)
* [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
* [Reactive System Architecture (RSA)](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
* Test Driven Development

Developers will find it helpful to be familiar with
* [C4 Model Of Software Architecture](https://c4model.com)
* [Akka](https://akka.io)
