The duties of the domain expert in the context or making a system specification with
RIDDL are to, simply, provide their expertise. Although helpful, it is not necessary
to understand all the details of RIDDL in order to collaborate with 
[authors]({{< relref "../authors" >}}) and [implementors]({{< relref "../implementors" >}})
on the system model's definition.

## Know Your Domain
Whatever it is that you know as an expert, that domain knowledge is essential to
the correct construction of a system model. Make sure that you do know it backwards,
upside down, and inside out. Your knowledge from direct experience with the domain
will be most helpful.  For example, if you only know rocket science from the 
perspective of theoretcial physics text books, your expertise will be theoretically 
correct but practically useless without hands on experience of building rockets that
successfully reach their objectives.

## Communicate Your Domain

## Be Consistent

## Respect The Expertise Of Others

## Be Open To New Ideas

## Be Patient With Non-Experts
