*Question:*
> Should each command have its own event, containing the exact changed entity?

### Examples:

```
event OrganizationEstablished {
    id: OrganizationId
    info: Info,
    members: MemberId*,
    contacts: Contacts,
}

event OrganizationInfoModified {
    id: OrganizationId
    info: Info,
    members: MemberId*,
    contacts: Contacts,
}

event OrganizationMembersModified {
    id: OrganizationId
    info: Info,
    members: MemberId*,
    contacts: Contacts,
}

event OrganizationContactsModified {
    id: OrganizationId
    info: Info,
    members: MemberId*,
    contacts: Contacts,
}
```

## Suggestions

This affords much more traceability, but there is a lot of extraneous data 
coming back in non-creation events. While it makes sense to return the entire
entity in UserEstablished as it was just created and has never been received
from backend where data could have been added automatically, the other events
could have their parameters pared down a bit. This could be considered an
antipattern from that perspective.
