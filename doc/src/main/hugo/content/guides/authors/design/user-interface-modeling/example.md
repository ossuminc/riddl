## E-Commerce Example
In this section we will use an _Epic_ and an _Application_ to
completely describe the familiar e-commerce process of filling
an online shopping and checking out. This involves just enough
complexity to show the UI design in RIDDL without overburdening
the reader with domain complexity.

## The Application
The application provides the inputs and outputs that a user
can use to communicate with the system it represents. 

## The Epic
The epic describes what happens in certain use cases of the
application.


> TBD: Finish defining the example, with pictures
