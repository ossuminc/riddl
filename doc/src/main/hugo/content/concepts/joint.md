Joints join [Processor]({{< relref "processor.md" >}}) 
[Inlets]({{< relref "inlet.md" >}}) or 
[Outlets]({{< relref "outlet.md" >}}) to 
[pipes]({{< relref "pipe.md" >}}). There are two kinds of joints: 
* InletJoint - connects an Inlet to a Pipe
* OutletJoint - connects and Outlet to a Pipe

Joints are necessary to set up a pipeline in a Plant which must flow data 
from [source]({{< relref "processor.md" >}}) to 
[sink]({{< relref "processor.md" >}}).
