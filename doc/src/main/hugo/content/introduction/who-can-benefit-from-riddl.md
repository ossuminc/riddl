RIDDL is technology-agnostic, but not design-agnostic. It is purposefully 
aimed at the design of large scale, distributed systems based on a 
reactive architecture. RIDDL allows specification of the design of a system, 
without regard to programming language, cloud vendor choice, or specific 
technology choices. Using RIDDL allows a living design to evolve through
every stage of the development process and then through continuing
maintenance and evolution of the system designed.

Consequently, the people who can benefit from RIDDL are software development
teams that want a precise and consistent way of specifying its evolving design
as a guide to all stakeholders. RIDDL aims to support such teams with
productivity increases by:
* integrating with SBOM tools like Backstage
* rapidly generating documentation with every change to keep the team on the 
  same page
* rapidly generating interface code for things like Smithy, Protocol Buffers,
  and OpenAPI
* providing the software context for use with a GPT-based code generator
  to speed up development and refactoring.
