The originator of RIDDL, Reid Spencer, got to a point in his 40+ year career
where the job of software development became tedious and repetitive. He decided 
to do something about it.

Notes for future content TBD:
* 1990s rise of 4GLs
* Insufficient existing specification languages
* Something simpler for business users
* Something highly translatable for code generation
* Recognizing that Ai will soon write software
* Need specifications that can be translated to many forms
* Need something easily readable 
* Self-documenting specifications
