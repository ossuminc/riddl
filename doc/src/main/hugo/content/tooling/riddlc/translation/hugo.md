## About Hugo Generation

Hugo documentation generation creates a complete Hugo static site from your
RIDDL model, including:

- Automatically generated documentation pages for all definitions
- Diagrams showing relationships between contexts, entities, and other elements
- Navigation structure matching your domain hierarchy
- Cross-references between related definitions

For documentation and usage instructions, see the
[riddl-gen repository](https://github.com/ossuminc/riddl-gen).
