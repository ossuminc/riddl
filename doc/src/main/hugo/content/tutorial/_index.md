Some people can learn RIDDL faster by looking at examples than they can by 
reading the informal definitions in the 
[language guide]({{< relref "../language" >}}) or the 
formal definitions in the 
[grammar section]({{< relref "../guides/developers/grammar" >}}). 
To support that mode of learning, this tutorial decomposes the domain of a 
fictitious restaurant, The Reactive BBQ.

As you will see, the Reactive BBQ is an expansive domain. As such, this 
tutorial will not attempt to have you specify the entire domain. Rather, we 
will work through each feature of the RIDDL language by considering examples
from inside the Reactive BBQ domain. We have fully specified it so that you 
have a concrete reference implementation and the companion language 
references to guide you. You can find the fully implemented 
Reactive BBQ RIDDL specification here. The language reference can be 
found here.
