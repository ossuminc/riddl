# RIDDL Backlog

The single home for open work: tasks, features, bugs, and design questions not
yet decided. **If it is not here, it is not tracked.** Items carry the
verification already done, with `file:line` where a claim was checked against
the code, so the next session does not re-derive it.

Completed items leave this file: what they taught goes to `NOTEBOOK.md`, what
is durably true goes to `CLAUDE.md`. Incoming `task/*.md` files are INPUTS —
triage them with `/ossuminc-skills:check-tasks` and file what survives here.

Lines migrated from NOTEBOOK.md predate the 80-column rule for this file; clean
them as items are touched rather than in one sweep.

Large items get their own plan (`~/.claude/plans/`) before implementation; the
plan is discarded once built.

### 0. Just before 2.0.0 is released

Things deliberately deferred to the release itself, not to be done piecemeal.

- **Run one `scalafmt` pass.** Formatting is not a gate before 2.0 (Reid,
  2026-08-04); do not run `scalafmtCheckAll`, report it, or format
  incrementally. `sbt scalafmtCheck` is red on HEAD — 7 committed files
  reformat, 6 in `commands`.
- **Upgrade riddl-vscode.** Reid, 2026-08-06 — deferred here deliberately, not
  overlooked. It consumes `@ossuminc/riddl-lib` via npm, which carries only
  PUBLISHED releases, so it cannot take a staged build at all and chasing it
  between RCs means cutting an RC for its benefit. It is on `2.0.0-rc.9`
  (`package.json:128`); bring it to 2.0.0 when 2.0.0 exists.
- **Regenerate every checked-in `.bast`.** Reid, 2026-08-06 — same reasoning:
  `FORMAT_REVISION` has moved twice in one day (6 -> 7 -> 8) and may move again
  before 2.0, so regenerating now buys nothing. riddl-models is the known holder.
  In-repo fixtures are NOT deferred — `language/input/import/NotImplemented.bast`
  must be regenerated at each bump or `IncludeAndImportTest` reddens.
  **Regenerate it FROM ITS OWN DIRECTORY**, or the `.bast` embeds a different
  source path than the committed one and the diff stops being a one-field
  revision bump:
  ```
  sbt riddlc/stage
  cd language/input/import && <repo>/target/out/jvm/scala-<ver>/riddlc/universal/stage/bin/riddlc bastify NotImplemented.riddl
  ```
  Done right the file is 93 bytes and `cmp` against the committed one differs
  at byte 12 (the revision short) and nowhere else — check that, since a
  larger diff means the path got baked in. (`sbt clean` deletes the stage, so
  regenerate the fixture BEFORE certifying, not after.)
- **Update `../RIDDL-Computational-Model.md` with everything `release/2`
  changed.** Reid, 2026-08-06. That document is the authority for any lowering
  decision — what a conforming generator MUST preserve versus may freely choose
  — so a language change that does not reach it leaves generator authors working
  from a stale contract. This branch has changed a lot of what it describes:
  entity intentions and the four event-sourcing rules, the unified processor
  model, implicit invariant scope, `requires`/`returns` in contents,
  `Riddl.Envelope` + `option message_envelope`, A56 (`tell p`) and A57
  (`on other as x`). Work from `git log 2.0.0-rc.1..HEAD` rather than memory.
- **Update the ossum.tech documentation site** with the same syntax changes,
  **plus a LIGHTER treatment of the implied syntax.** Reid, 2026-08-06 — the
  reference currently spells out more of the implicit forms than a reader needs,
  and the balance should shift toward what someone actually writes. Same source
  of truth: the commits on this branch, not recollection.
  (ossum.tech is a separate repo; this is a task DROP, not work done here.)

### 1. Queued, designed, not started

- **BUG: `validateConstructor` does not follow type aliases.** Found
  2026-08-13 by the Task 6 review of the processor-instance-identity plan;
  pre-existing, not introduced there. `validateConstructor`
  (`ValidationPass.scala:6058-6060`) computes a constructor's fields with
  `typ.typEx match { case ate: AggregateTypeExpression => ate.fields; case _ =>
  Seq.empty }` — no alias-following. So `command Ship is Shipment` followed by
  `command Ship(orderId = oid)` misreports *"'orderId' is not a field of Type
  'Ship'"* and gets the arity wrong, on a legal model.
  **The fix already exists next door:** `checkTellAddressing`'s `fieldsWithOwner`
  (`ValidationPass.scala:5291-5296`) walks `AliasedTypeExpression` through
  `resolution.refMap.definitionOf[Type](ate.pathId)` recursively, as does the
  older `aggregateFieldsOf` (`:5426-5434`). Reuse one of them rather than
  writing a third.
  Verified real: Task 6's alias regression tests had to route AROUND this bug
  (bare `MessageRef` tells, no constructor args) to test what they were actually
  testing. Needs a corpus A/B — this can only REMOVE false errors, but count
  them, since a model may have been edited to satisfy the wrong diagnostic.

- **BUG (shipped in rc.13): statement-scope checks miss nested statements.**
  Found 2026-08-13 by a code review of unrelated work. `checkStateReadScope` is
  wired into `validateStatement`, which only sees statements the pass dispatcher
  visits. `Statement extends RiddlValue`, NOT `Branch`, so `Pass.traverse`'s
  final `case value: RiddlValue` arm never descends into
  `WhenStatement.thenStatements`, `MatchCase.statements` or
  `ForeachStatement.doStatements` — those are FIELDS, the same hazard
  `Pass.scala:311-326` (SagaStep) and `:329-340` (Correlation) each needed a
  special case for. `statementValues` does not recurse either.
  **So the `set` and `get from state` scope rules from `0f06d85d9` silently do
  not apply inside `when` / `match` / `foreach`.** A `set` in a context handler
  is an Error at statement top level and accepted one `when` deeper.
  The depth-complete hook already exists and is the fix: `checkStatementScopes`
  (`ValidationPass.scala:5967`) recurses at `:6026` and `:6040` and calls
  `validateValue` at any depth. Move the check there, keeping ONE call site.
  Needs a corpus A/B — this can only ADD messages, and the models that were
  silently passing may be numerous.

- **GAP: 13 shared `language` parser suites — 169 test cases — have NEVER run
  on Native.** Found 2026-08-13 by chasing a ONE-test shortfall in the
  instance-identity certification (predicted Native +68, got +67).
  They live in `language/src/test/scala/.../parsing/`, which reads like "all
  three platforms", but each is **abstract** and its concrete runners are
  declared only in `scalajvm/.../JVMTests.scala` and
  `scalajs/.../JSTests.scala`. There is no `NativeTests.scala`. Verified by
  diffing the suite names in the JS and Native `language` rows of the
  certification log — they overlap almost nowhere.
  Counts (`in {` per suite): `StatementsTest` 52, `TypeParserTest` 37,
  `HandlerTest` 19, `ParsingTestTest` 19, `CommonParserTest` 9,
  `ProjectorTest` 8, `StreamingParserTest` 7, `ApplicationParsingTest` 6,
  `ModuleTest` 4, `MetaDataTest` 3, `RepositoryTest` 2, `TokenParserTest` 2,
  `NebulaTest` 1.
  **Fix is probably one file** — a `scalanative/.../NativeTests.scala` mirroring
  the other two. Do it as its own change with its own certification, NOT
  alongside a feature: it will raise the Native floor by ~169 in one step, and
  if any parser behaves differently on Native (`String` handling and
  `fastparse` are the plausible risks) the failures must be attributable to
  this change alone.
  The trap is already documented in `.claude/skills/rc/SKILL.md` as the
  "reverse trap"; what was missing was anyone measuring it. A floor is a total,
  and a total cannot say what is absent from it.

- **UNDECIDED: are `initiate`/`terminate` legal inside a SAGA STEP?** Raised
  three times during the instance-identity plan (2026-08-13) and never ruled,
  so it is filed rather than lost. **They are legal today by DEFAULT, not by
  decision:** `checkInstanceEffectScope`
  (`ValidationPass.scala:1029-1054`) bans them in exactly two shapes — a
  parent that is an `OnActivationClause`/`OnPassivationClause`, or any
  `Function` in the parent chain — and for a saga-step statement `parents.head`
  is the **Saga** (a `SagaStep` is a `Leaf` and is never pushed; see
  `Pass.traverse`), so both predicates are structurally false. Nothing tests
  either way.
  **The likely answer is "legal"** — a saga step exists to have effects, which
  is exactly why the two existing bans do not name it — but a construct that is
  permitted because nobody wrote the predicate is not the same as one that is
  permitted on purpose, and the third banned context (a correlation fold) shows
  the design does discriminate. Reid to rule; then either add a test pinning
  legality or add the predicate.

- **INCONSISTENT: `checkInitiate`/`checkTerminate` do NOT apply the `???`-stub
  exemption; `checkTellAddressing` does.** Audited 2026-08-13 during Task 8 of
  the instance-identity plan, deliberately NOT fixed there — a behaviour change
  would have invalidated the certification run it sat in.
  `initClauseParameters`/`termClauseParameters`
  (`ValidationPass.scala:5276`, `:5338`) return `Seq.empty` when the target
  declares no `on init`/`on term` clause, and `???` parses to empty contents
  (`CommonParser.undefined`), so a target whose whole body is unwritten is
  INDISTINGUISHABLE from one that deliberately declares a zero-parameter
  clause. `entity Order is { ??? }` addressed by `initiate entity Order(x =
  "1")` therefore draws a hard **Error** — *"Order declares 'on init' with no
  parameters, but 1 argument supplied"* — which is reasoning from an unwritten
  body, exactly what the standing `???` ruling (Reid, 2026-08-11) forbids.
  Task 6's `checkTellAddressing` got this right by gating on the RESOLVED field
  list being non-empty (`:5442`), and its scaladoc records why.
  Note the zero-argument case is already silent (`0 != 0` is false), so only
  `initiate`/`terminate` WITH arguments against a stub misfires.
  **Fix**: gate both on the target being non-stub, the same way; needs a corpus
  A/B, though it can only REMOVE messages. Add a test for each — a stub target
  with arguments must be silent, a real zero-parameter clause with arguments
  must still Error, or the fix erases a correct diagnostic along with the wrong
  one.

- **Cross-context `tell` isolation seam — Error, but MEASURE FIRST.**
  Reid ruled 2026-08-13 that a `tell` into a different context is an Error
  unless the message type is declared in a domain ancestral to both; across
  domains an
  adaptor is always required. Separately and independently, a cross-context tell
  is **always** a durable channel — the common-domain exemption waives the
  adaptor, never the durability.
  This completes **A4 (ACCEPTED)**, which already rejects foreign *message
  types* outside adaptor scope; this extends the same seam to foreign
  *processor targets*.
  **Do not ship the Error before counting.** A heuristic says 5,301
  cross-context tells (64% of all tells) but the method is unsound, and the
  exemption's size is UNMEASURABLE by grep: 603 of 996 corpus files are include
  fragments with no top-level construct, so nothing file-local can tell a
  domain-level message type from a context-level one. Build the check with a
  counting mode, run it under riddlc's real resolution, then decide the
  migration.

- **Clusterability: `clustered`, and `self.isClustered`.** Split out of the
  identity design 2026-08-13. NOT "multiplicity" — Reid ruled that **entity is
  the only multiply-instantiated processor**; contexts, projectors, streamlets,
  repositories and adaptors are singletons that may be clustered for resilience,
  and clustered instances are interchangeable so clustering does not affect
  addressability. `self.isClustered` was deliberately kept out of the identity
  spec because it would have forward-referenced vocabulary this item defines.

- **Survey the CM and every A item for future `self` fields.** Reid, 2026-08-13.
  `self` currently carries `id` and `version`. Find the other usually-available
  pieces of processor information that belong there, classifying each by whether
  it is statically knowable — in which case a generator inlines it and it does
  NOT belong on `self` — or genuinely runtime-only, which is the admission test
  the design settled on. `self.isClustered` is already claimed by the
  clusterability item above.

- **Computational Model amendments owed by the identity design.** Three, all
  from 2026-08-13: (a) "activate on first message" (§4, line 999) must become
  rehydrate-an-existing-instance, never create-on-demand, now that `initiate`
  invokes `on init` explicitly; (b) the memory-space axiom — only processors
  within one context are guaranteed to share memory, which is what licenses a
  generator to optimize the same-context `tell`; (c) `Id(P)` (runtime instance
  identity) must not be conflated with the definition ULIDs of line 2523
  (model-time identity of a definition).

- **BLOCKED UNTIL 3.0 — drop the deprecated inline aggregation from
  `requires`/`returns`, then narrow the accessors to `Option[TypeRef]`.**
  **Reid, 2026-08-12: wait for 3.0.** Removing a deprecated form is a breaking
  change, and the compatibility policy in `CLAUDE.md` allows it only in the next
  MAJOR release — the inline form was deprecated during 2.x development, so 2.0
  is not where it goes. Do not start this against `release/2`; the detail below
  is kept because it was verified and would otherwise be re-derived in a year.
  Originally decided by Reid 2026-08-04 while moving the clauses into contents: `Option[TypeRef]` is the wanted END state,
  but it is a language change, not a type tidy-up, so it does not ride along.
  Today `Requires.what` / `Returns.what` are `TypeRef | Aggregation` and
  `Function.input` / `Saga.input` return `Option[TypeRef | Aggregation]` —
  **exactly the type the constructor fields had**, which is why the move cost
  consumers nothing.
  **Do NOT narrow the accessor while the node stays wide.** A saga written
  `requires { a: Integer }` would then read as having no input at all, and any
  check gated on `input.isEmpty` fires wrongly — the ungated-accessor failure
  mode this repo keeps rediscovering.
  **Verified cost of doing it properly** (checked 2026-08-04, not estimated):
  4 fixtures use the inline form — `language/input/everything_full.riddl:72,97`,
  `language/input/module/mixed-module.riddl:17`,
  `language/input/requires-returns-ref.riddl` — plus two tests that ASSERT the
  deprecation fires (`FunctionValidatorTest:106`, `SagaValidatorTest:56`), the
  `aggregation` alternative in `func_input`/`func_output` in the EBNF + a GBNF
  regen, the `ArgDto.fields` read path in JSON, and an external-corpus re-run.
  Sequence: deprecate loudly for a release, then remove.

### 2. Queued, needs a plan
- **Audit the remaining catch-all matches against Reid's no-silent-fallthrough
  rule.** Reid ruled 2026-08-09: *"There must be no non-sealed matches — it is
  okay to fall through to generate an error or exception but not okay to not
  select anything and then carry on as if nothing happened."* Offered as a
  follow-up and never answered, so it is filed rather than lost.

  **What is already done** (do not redo): the total dispatches were fixed at
  `286ef8157` and around it — `Pass.processValue` now throws on an unhandled
  `Value` rather than returning unit, `BASTWriter`/`BASTReader` throw instead of
  a `println`-and-drop and a placeholder `PromptStatement`, `classifyHandlers`
  enumerates all 17 `Statement` kinds with no catch-all, and
  `countValueFailPoints` enumerates the rest.

  **What is NOT done:** roughly 140 remaining `case _ => ()` sites across the
  codebase, most of which are legitimately "not interested in this node" rather
  than "silently gave up". The work is to separate those two, not to delete the
  arm — a mechanical sweep would be wrong. Suggested order: `passes/` first
  (where a miss changes validation results), then `language/`, then the
  serialization surfaces, which are already done.

  Start with `grep -rn "case _ =>" --include=*.scala passes/ language/ | wc -l`
  to size it before committing to a plan.

- **Finish the `Streamlet` → `Processor` migration in the remaining passes.**
  Filed by Reid 2026-08-10 when the same defect was fixed in
  `StreamingValidation` (`70b0f527a`). These sites narrow to the concrete
  `Streamlet` case class the same way the streaming graph did, so they see one
  of the six processor kinds and silently ignore the rest:

  - `AnalysisResult.scala:179` — `symbols.parentage.keys.collect { case s:
    Streamlet => s }`. **Public API whose MEANING would change**, so it needs a
    decision, not just an edit: does `AnalysisResult.streamlets` mean "the
    Streamlet definitions" or "the port-bearing processors"? Adding a second
    accessor is the additive option the compatibility policy prefers.
  - `MessageFlowPass.scala:291,303`
  - `DiagramsPass.scala:193,216,394,450,456`
  - `StatsPass.scala:171`

  Out of scope deliberately in `70b0f527a` — different consumers, and the
  public-API question above. `Pass.scala`'s `openStreamlet`/`closeStreamlet`
  and `RiddlFileEmitter`/`PrettifyVisitor`'s uses are NOT in this list: those
  are legitimately about the case class (visitor hooks, keyword emission).

- **Decide whether stream reachability should require a `Source`-SHAPED head.**
  Surfaced by the corpus A/B for `70b0f527a`, not theorised. With the graph
  widened, two reactive-bbq repositories now report `is a sink but has no
  upstream path from any source`. The message is LITERALLY true — tracing
  `TableOrderRepository` upstream gives `TableOrderEventSplit` (split) ←
  `TableOrder` (`event-sourced entity … as flow`) ← `RestaurantApp`
  (`application context … as router`) — there is no `Source`-shaped processor
  anywhere in the chain. Data enters that pipeline through an application
  context fed by users, not from a `source`.

  So `originates` (`StreamingValidation.scala`) asks "is this Source-shaped?"
  when the useful question may be "does this have no inbound edge in the
  graph?". Related hole in the arity mapping: `shapeForArity` sends
  (out ≥ 2, in = 0) to `Void` as degenerate, so a multi-outlet, no-inlet
  processor is neither a Source nor reported.

  **Reid ruled 2026-08-11: a head must be OUTLET-shaped, not `Source`-shaped.**
  Any outlet whose type matches the Connector's will do, and the processor may
  have MORE outlets besides — which is exactly what `Source`-shaped rules out
  and why reactive-bbq trips today. So `originates` becomes "has an outlet of
  the connector's type", not "is a Source".

  He also asked a question this item must answer before the change lands:
  *"sink with no upstream source probably means no connector connected?"* —
  i.e. whether the two reported repositories are genuinely UNWIRED (no
  connector reaching them at all), in which case the message is right and only
  its WORDING is wrong, or wired-but-not-from-a-`Source`, in which case the
  rule is wrong. **Determine which before writing code** — they need opposite
  fixes, and the corpus is the evidence.

- **A lookup value: `<mapping|array> at <index>`.** Reid, 2026-08-10, syntax his
  suggestion. Wants a plan. Filed out of the `foreach`-over-a-mapping question:
  the destructuring form below covers the loop body, but **outside a loop a
  mapping is currently write-only** — there is no way to name the value stored
  at a key, so a model can declare a mapping and never read it. The same holds
  inside a loop for any key other than the one being iterated.

  **Verified absent, not assumed.** The `Value` union is `LiteralString |
  PromptValue | Constructor | ValueRef | GetValue | BooleanExpression | Call |
  Ask` (AST.scala:2933) — nothing indexes. `GetValue` (AST.scala:3081) is `get
  from <inlet|state>`, a read of a port or state, not a subscript. The grammar
  has no subscript form either; `index on <field>` (ebnf-grammar.ebnf:439) is
  schema metadata.

  **Design questions the plan must answer:**
  - **What it yields when the key is absent** — the hard one. An Optional
    result needs a way to interrogate it, which RIDDL has no syntax for; an
    Error is untrue, since a missing key is ordinary; a total function needs a
    default nobody declared. Most likely `canFail = true` and let the value's
    existing failure machinery carry it, which is what `countValueFailPoints`
    already does for `send`/`tell`/`call`/`yield`/`reply`/`put`/`get`.
  - **What it applies to.** `Mapping` by key is the motivating case. A
    `Sequence`/`Table` by ordinal is the "array" half of Reid's syntax, and
    `Set`/`Graph` have no index at all, so this is not simply "any collection".
  - **The result type** — `to` for a Mapping, the element type for a sequence.
    `collectionElementType` (ValidationPass) already computes the latter.
  - Whether `at` reads well in a `when` guard, its most likely home.

- **A keyword-named field reports the error several tokens upstream.** From
  riddl-generator 2026-08-03, filed here because it is a real diagnostic defect
  even though they marked it "no action needed". A field in a message
  aggregation named after a keyword — `command Store is { entity: Order }` —
  reports `Expected one of ("(" | "yields")` pointing at the `is`, several
  tokens BEFORE the offending `entity`. The rule (keywords are not field names)
  is correct; the attribution is what costs time, and it is the same class of
  cost as the saga-comment defect fixed in `867ab0333` — a message that does not
  name the thing that is actually wrong. Wants a plan because good attribution
  here likely means a cut/`~/` placement change in the aggregation rule, and
  those interact with `rep` termination (see the statement-restriction pattern
  note in memory). Low priority; a nuisance, not a blocker.
- **Move ResolutionPass off `ClassTag` for type differentiation.** A measured
  cleanup, NOT a fix for anything currently slow — filed 2026-08-03 after the
  ClassTag hypothesis was tested and refuted as the cause of the Scala.js
  resolution cost (that was the source-file hashing; see NOTEBOOK).
  `isSameKind` (ResolutionPass.scala:661) does
  `classTag[DEF].runtimeClass.isAssignableFrom(d.getClass)`. Measured over
  168,400 tests by `TypeTestCostBenchmark` (`passes/src/test/scala/`):

  | strategy | JVM | JS | Native |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | current (classTag per call) | 19.5 ms | 3.6 ms | 0.9 ms |
  | hoisted (runtimeClass once) | 17.2 ms | 3.8 ms | 0.2 ms |
  | predicate (stored lambda) | 2.9 ms | 2.0 ms | 0.5 ms |
  | direct (isInstanceOf) | 0.9 ms | 0.9 ms | 0.1 ms |

  So ClassTag costs 20x a direct `isInstanceOf` on the JVM, 15x on Native, 4x
  on JS — worst, in absolute terms, on the platform nobody is complaining
  about. A stored predicate recovers most of it and adds NO data to any node;
  Scala 3's `TypeTest[Definition, T]` reaches the `direct` row outright,
  because at call sites where `T` is statically known the compiler emits a
  plain `isInstanceOf`.
  **Why it needs a plan rather than a patch:** ResolutionPass does not only
  TEST with the ClassTag, it also reads `classTag[T].runtimeClass.getSimpleName`
  for error messages (:922, :946) and compares exact class identity (:1271,
  :1275). Moving off ClassTag therefore wants a small `Kind` abstraction
  carrying both a predicate and a display name, threaded through ~13 generic
  methods. That is a real refactor for a few milliseconds on the JVM, so it is
  explicitly LOW priority — do not bundle it with performance work that has a
  measured user impact.
- ~~`BASTPerformanceBenchmark` is timing-flaky~~ — **DONE 2026-08-07,
  `5c3d5cbc8`.** Cold single-shot measurement now reported, not asserted; the
  warmed 50-iteration benchmark gates on the MEDIAN rather than the mean.
- ~~`BASTParserInput`'s synthetic line index is unreachable dead code~~ — **DONE
  2026-08-07, `307812fa8`, but the premise here was FALSE and cost a wrong
  first move.** This entry claimed "with `positionsKnown = false`, `At` never
  consults its `lineOf`/`offsetOf`". It did: `At.endLine` and the `endCol`
  inside `At.toLong` were UNGUARDED, so the 10000-chars-per-line scheme was
  live, and every BAST-sourced message formatted as `(0:0->1:N)` — honest start
  line, fabricated end line. It was wrong OUTPUT, not dead code. Deleting the
  overrides under the stated premise would have moved the fabrication into the
  base class instead of removing it. Guarding `endLine`/`endCol` came first;
  only then was the machinery genuinely dead.
- **Should an imported definition RESOLVE without an explicit flatten?** The
  accessors now report `.bast`-imported definitions (2026-08-03), so
  `domain.types` lists an imported type — but a reference to it still fails to
  resolve until `FlattenPass` runs, because the symbol table is built by
  traversal rather than by the accessors. That split is currently pinned by
  `BASTImportLoadingTest`, and it is defensible (reading is the client's
  question, resolving is the model's), but it means a model can name a type its
  own accessors report. Decide whether SymbolsPass should index wrapper
  contents, or whether the flatten requirement should be stated more loudly.
- ~~**A conditionally refusing clause escapes yield conformance**~~ — **DONE
  2026-08-07, `1d87a109a`**, at BOTH sites (Reid's call): the Error in
  `checkYieldConformance` and its CompletenessWarning sibling.
  `dischargesOnEveryPath` replaces "does a refusal appear ANYWHERE in the
  clause". A `when` needs both branches, a `match` needs every case AND a
  `default`, a `foreach` never discharges. Error wording moved to "does not
  yield it on every path" — "never" stopped being true.
  **Two findings worth keeping:**
  1. **Emitting ANY message settles a path**, not just yielding the declared
     event or refusing with `error`/`require`. The first version assumed
     declining means `error`/`require`, and NO in-repo fixture could have
     contradicted it, because every fixture shared the assumption. riddl-models
     reactive-bbq (`LoyaltyAccount.riddl:579`) declines by RECORDING a rejection
     event — the more faithful design for an event-sourced entity. The external
     corpus was the only thing that could catch this.
  2. **An empty `else { }` is a PARSE ERROR** — an empty pseudo-code block does
     not parse. So the escape is not an empty else but a NON-EMPTY one that
     neither yields nor refuses. Making `else`/`default` mandatory in the
     grammar was considered and REJECTED (Reid, 2026-08-07): ~56 sites across
     three repos, and it would not have closed the hole anyway.
- **The QueryCase completeness check shares the "anywhere in the clause"
  shape.** Filed 2026-08-07 out of `1d87a109a`, deliberately not changed there —
  it was not the approved hole, and it has no refusal exemption, so the
  conditional-refusal escape does not apply to it in the same way. QueryCase
  still asks whether a result-emitting statement appears anywhere rather than on
  every path. Decide whether it should use `dischargesOnEveryPath` too; if so,
  expect the same kind of corpus correction the command case needed.
- ~~`Comment` in a `Group`'s contents cannot be rebuilt~~ — **STALE, resolved
  somewhere along the way; removed after verifying 2026-08-06.** Both halves of
  the claim are now false: `OccursInGroup` DOES include `Comment`
  (`AST.scala:900`) and `GroupParser.groupDefinitions` accepts it
  (`GroupParser.scala:28`). The "3 pinned occurrences" are gone —
  `Root2JsonFixturesTest` reports `identical=91`, `lossy=0`, `divergent=0`, and
  the test carries no Comment allowance. No decision needed; nothing to do.
- **Saga step statements are NEVER VALIDATED — not just reachability.**
  **⚠ LIKELY ALREADY FIXED — verify and close before doing any work here.**
  Found 2026-08-11: `git log -S "case sagaStep: SagaStep =>" -- passes/…/Pass.scala`
  gives **`a1bce0d50` (2026-08-07) "Traverse saga step statements, which were
  never validated at all"** — one day AFTER this item was filed. `Pass.traverse`
  now has a `SagaStep` case ahead of `case leaf: Leaf` that traverses
  `doStatements`/`undoStatements`, which is exactly the root cause described
  below. Re-run the repro before treating any of the following as true; if it is
  green, delete this item and keep only the reachability question if that
  survives. Not deleted outright because the entry has several sub-claims and
  only the traversal one was checked.

  Filed as "saga reachability", VERIFIED 2026-08-06 and it is materially worse
  than that.
  **Promoted: this is a silent correctness hole, not a missing warning.**

  Repro, one file, both statements identical in shape:

      entity Caller is { handler H is {
        on command Dom.Ours.Doit is {
          tell command Dom.Ours.NoSuchCommand to entity Dom.Ours.NoSuchEntity } } }
      saga Flow is {
        step One is {
          tell command Dom.Ours.AlsoBogus to entity Dom.Ours.AlsoMissing
        } reverted by { do "undo" } }

  riddlc reports `NoSuchCommand` and `NoSuchEntity` as unresolved. It reports
  **nothing at all** about `AlsoBogus` or `AlsoMissing`. A saga step can name
  definitions that do not exist and validate clean. The reachability warning is
  just the symptom that happened to get noticed.

  **Root cause, and it is a known shape:** `SagaStep extends Leaf`
  (`AST.scala:4802-4808`) with `doStatements` / `undoStatements` as FIELDS beside
  `contents` rather than in it, so the traversal never descends into them.

  **DONE 2026-08-07, `a1bce0d50` — but NOT the way this entry proposed, and the
  reason is kept so it is not re-proposed.** This entry called for the
  `3e4af6801` treatment: make `SagaStep` a `Branch`, statements into `contents`.
  **That precedent does not transfer:** it moved two SINGLETON clauses into one
  ordered list, whereas a SagaStep has TWO distinct blocks, and
  `JsonModel.SagaStepDto` exposes them as separate `do` and `undo` arrays.
  Merging them loses a distinction the JSON wire format — read by synapify and
  riddl-gen — depends on, and forces a BAST `FORMAT_REVISION` bump.

  What was done instead: one `SagaStep` case in the base `Pass.traverse`,
  descending into both statement lists WITHOUT pushing (`ParentStack.push` takes
  a `Branch[?]`; Include and BASTImport already traverse this way, and
  `parents.head` staying the Saga is the correct resolution scope). No AST, JSON
  or BAST change. ~12 `Pass`-derived passes now see saga statements;
  `HierarchyPass` overrides `traverse` entirely, so Prettify, BASTWriter,
  Outline and Tree were untouched.

  The predicted "wave of findings" did not materialise — 23 saga steps across
  all three corpora, and the only golden change was the REMOVAL of two FALSE
  `is unused` warnings (`blah` and `UndoSomething` are named by a step's `send`
  statements, so they were never unused, only unseen).
- ~~**`validateArbitraryInteraction`'s refMap path is dead**~~ — **ALREADY FIXED
  at `55d5dc6d9` (2026-07-27), "Fix arbitrary-interaction ref resolution (was
  dead — wrong refMap key)".** Discovered 2026-08-07 while planning to implement
  it: the call site already resolves with `useCase` as the scope and carries a
  comment saying so. This entry sat open for eleven days after the work shipped.
- ~~`PlatformContext.withOptions` lacks try/finally~~ — **STALE; `withOptions`
  was fixed at `2eefeec52` (2026-07-27), eight days before this entry was last
  read.** The unfixed twin was `withLogger`, directly above it, with the same
  failure mode: a throwing body leaves the swapped-in logger installed globally,
  so a later sequential suite writes into a dead test's capture buffer. **DONE
  2026-08-07, `359949e83`.**
- ~~**`Blob`, `Unknown`, `Range` are RESERVED BUT UNUSABLE.**~~ — **DONE
  2026-08-07, `f41cf399f`**, all three parts. Left below because the DIAGNOSIS
  is the durable part: three tables that look authoritative, two of which are
  not. Two residues were filed rather than fixed — see the two entries after
  this one. Original analysis, verified 2026-08-07
  by three `riddlc` probes, correcting an earlier reading of this entry that
  treated tokenizing as evidence of parseability — it is not. For all three,
  `type X is <Name>` fails with "Path '<Name>' was not resolved", AND defining
  your own type by that name fails with "redefines built-in type" — unusable in
  both directions. The cause is two tables that drifted apart:
  `PredefType.allPredefTypes` (reserves names; read by `ValidationPass:1268`)
  and `PredefTypes.anyPredefType` (tokenizer only; read by `TokenParser:61`).
  Neither is the REAL type parser, which is `TypeParser.predefinedTypes:327`.
  **Reid ruled 2026-08-07 — three different jobs, not one cleanup:**
  1. **Add `Blob` to the parser.** It is a legitimate type missing only its
     syntax: `AST.Blob(loc, BlobKind)` exists, the `BlobKind` enum exists,
     BASTWriter/Reader round-trip it and `ASTTest:117-124` tests its `format`.
     Grammar-surface change — parser rule + EBNF + GBNF regen + prettify +
     round-trip test + corpus re-run.
  2. **Drop capitalized `Range`, keep `range(n,m)`.** The working type is the
     LOWERCASE `range(1,10)` (`TypeParser:617` via `Keywords.range`,
     `Keyword.range = "range"`, verified validating clean). Capitalized `Range`
     is a phantom that only reserves the name and mis-highlights it; dropping
     it frees `Range` for users.
  3. **Drop `Unknown`.** Nothing behind it — no AST node, no parser rule, just
     the reservation and a tokenizer entry.

- **`TypeParserTest` has never run on Native.** Found 2026-08-07 while checking
  where new tests executed. It is `abstract class TypeParserTest` with concrete
  subclasses ONLY in `language/src/test/scalajvm/.../JVMTests.scala:22` and
  `language/src/test/scalajs/.../JSTests.scala:22` — there is no Native one, so
  ScalaTest never instantiates it there. This is CLAUDE.md's documented trap #2
  (abstract spec with no concrete subclass: cases never appear in the log at
  all, not even as skipped). Pre-existing, NOT introduced by the Blob work.
  **Do not just add the subclass and assume green** — it would newly execute a
  large parser suite on a platform that has never run it, and this repo's own
  history says to expect findings on a first run. Worth checking whether other
  `language` suites have the same gap; the audit is the task, not the one-liner.
- **Arity exemption for `error-sink` inlets** — riddl-models asked; deferred as a
  design decision, then FIXED in rc.9. Verify nothing else wants it.

### 3. Owed to other repos
- ~~**Tell consumers about two BREAKING changes landed 2026-08-10.**~~
  **CLOSED 2026-08-11 by Reid: no announcement needed**, for either half.
  Recorded so it is not re-raised: (1) BAST `FORMAT_REVISION`, now **11**, so
  every `.bast` from an earlier build is rejected with a message telling the
  reader to regenerate; (2) a mapping's VALUE type is now resolved
  (`b307909b5`), so `mapping from K to Nonexistent` used to validate clean and
  now errors. The second needed no ruling on BEHAVIOUR at any point — it is a
  correct tightening — only on whether to notify, which is what is now closed.

- ~~Restage `~/Code/ossuminc/bin/riddlc`~~ — **DONE 2026-08-12**, at
  `2.0.0-rc.12-4-092ec2be`. Verified by BEHAVIOUR, not by version string: the
  two `when invariant X` reproducers that threw on rc.12 now validate clean.
  **`bin/riddlc` is the NATIVE binary, a REAL FILE** (Reid, 2026-08-12) — the
  same shape as `bin/riddlg`. It is not a symlink and not the JVM launcher, and
  `scripts/publish-and-stage.sh` now installs and verifies that exact path.
  **The arrangement this replaced is worth remembering, because it failed
  silently.** `bin/riddlc` used to be a hand-made symlink into `../riddlc-dist`,
  created a day before the script existed and invisible to git (`bin/` is
  ignored). The script wrote and verified `riddlc-dist/bin/riddlc` while its own
  header promised something about `bin/riddlc` — so the rule was enforced
  nowhere, and any change to the symlink would have left it reporting success
  over a frozen binary. `riddlc-dist/` is deleted; nothing references it.
  Restaging is still not a standalone act: the script runs `publishLocal` and
  `riddlcNative/nativeLink` in ONE sbt invocation, because the ivy artifacts and
  the CLI must never disagree about what the language accepts. Use the script;
  do not stage by hand.
- **synapify: `flattenAST` workaround can be dropped.** `Contents.definitions`
  became include- and import-transparent on 2026-08-06 (their task file, now in
  `task/done/`), so their 33 `.definitions` sites no longer need the tree
  physically flattened first. Nothing owed until they take a build containing
  it — worth folding into whatever upgrade task they get next rather than a task of
  its own, since the change is source-compatible and their current code stays
  correct. (The standing 'consumer sweep' item was removed 2026-08-12 — Reid:
  riddl-generator is on rc.12 and building its own rc.1, and the rest are not
  worth tracking here.)
- riddl-vscode: adoption task for `IncrementalValidator` — hold until the 2.0
  upgrade above, so they take one change rather than two.
- ~~ossum.tech doc debts~~ — **DROPPED as a task 2026-08-12** into
  `../ossum.tech/task/2026-08-12-riddl-2.0-doc-debts.md`, so it is tracked there
  now, not here. It carries the `ForeverEmpty`/`BottomlessPit` error-sink idiom,
  the event-sourced `on init` idiom, paths-into-Functions plus the new
  function-privacy StyleWarning, and the rc.12 language changes (`yields
  command`, the `set`/`get from state` scope rules, the reworded `do`-statements
  warning, `FORMAT_REVISION` 12, and the two previously-silent breaking changes).
  **One item was CANCELLED as stale, verified not recalled:** the
  `/riddl/2.0/licenses/` 404 no longer exists — `riddlc info` prints
  `github.com/ossuminc/riddl` and `opensource.org/license/apache-2-0`, neither of
  which is an ossum.tech URL.
