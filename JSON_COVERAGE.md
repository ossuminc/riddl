# JSON Input Method — Language Coverage Ledger

This ledger tracks how much of the RIDDL language the JSON input
method (`RiddlLib.parseJson`, `JsonModel` + `JsonAstBuilder`) can
express. The goal is **eventual total coverage** of every construct
RIDDL currently supports, delivered incrementally. Each AST node is
listed with a status:

- ✅ **done** — supported as of the named phase
- 🔜 **phase-N** — planned for phase N
- 🚫 **deferred** — intentionally out of scope (with reason)

When RIDDL gains a new construct, add a row here. Phase 9 adds an
automated guard test that fails if a concrete AST node has no entry.

**Schema reference:** `JSON_INPUT.md`. **Roadmap:** NOTEBOOK.md
("JSON input method — phased roadmap").

References (`TypeRef`, `CommandRef`, `EntityRef`, …) are not listed
separately: each is produced by the construct that contains it, so it
is covered in that construct's phase. The builder emits references as
`PathIdentifier`s and leaves resolution to the standard passes.

| Nebula | 🚫 deferred | a parse target, not a self-contained JSON document; Root is the JSON top level |
| Include | 🚫 deferred | file-reference mechanism; JSON is self-contained and the builder is no-I/O / Native-safe |
| BASTImport | 🚫 deferred | same reason as Include |
