    |# brief
    |The kitchen is where food is prepared
    |# details
    |The kitchen bounded context provides the ability for the kitchen staff
    |to interact with orders they are preparing. The kitchen is a client of
    |the orders bounded context and interacts with that context alone
    |the outstanding orders to be prepared. Everything else that happens in
    |the kitchen is out of scope for the restaurant automation software.
    |Consequently, this bounded context is pretty minimal.
    |### Subject-Verb-Object Statements
    |1. Kitchen displays orders
    |1. Order is sent to Kitchen for display
    |1. Order sends order status changes to Kitchen
    |1. Kitchen ignores drink items on order

  | Reactive BBQ Domain Definition
  |#details
  |This domain definition is designed to be instructive in the RIDDL language.
  |It uses the case study from the Lightbend Reactive Architecture course as
  |the basis for defining the domain. The course uses a set of interviews with
  |Reactive BBQ employees to define the requirements. This domain specification
  |is a possible result of analyzing that domain: the Reactive BBQ restaurant.
