/** The common options available to any pass. Common options occur before the command name on the <code>riddlc</code>
  * command line
  *
  * @param showTimes
  *   Controls whether pass timing is printed out
  * @param showIncludeTimes
  *   Controls whether include processing timing is printed out
  * @param verbose
  *   Controls whether verbose steps taken are printed out (useful to implementors of riddlc)
  * @param dryRun
  *   Controls whether everything should be done except the requested action (useful with verbose)
  * @param quiet
  *   Controls whether riddlc should not print anything out but just do the requested action (opposite of dryRun)
  * @param showWarnings
  *   Controls whether any warnings, of any kind, are printed out
  * @param showMissingWarnings
  *   Controls whether any missing Warnings are printed out
  * @param showStyleWarnings
  *   Controls whether any style Warnings are printed out
  * @param showUsageWarnings
  *   Controls whether any usage Warnings are printed out
  * @param showInfoMessages
  *   Controls whether any informative messages are printed out
  * @param debug
  *   Controls whether debug output should be printed out (this goes into the iterative data that verbose doesn't print)
  * @param sortMessagesByLocation
  *   When set to true, the messages put out will be sorted by their location in the model (file, line, column)
  * @param groupMessagesByKind
  *   When set to true, the messages put out will be grouped by their kind and sorted with the most severe first.
  * @param noANSIMessages
  *   When set to true, ANSI coloring is not used in the output
  * @param maxParallelParsing
  *   Provides the maximum number of threads to use when parsing in parallel. The default is the number of CPU cores on
  *   the machine the program is running on.
  * @param maxIncludeWait
  *   Provides the maximum amount of time that the parser should wait for a parallel include to finish processing. The
  *   default is 5 seconds.
  * @param warningsAreFatal
  *   When set to true, any warnings are handled as if they were errors and terminate riddlc with a non-zero status
